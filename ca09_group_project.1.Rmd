# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


#Exploratory Data Analysis for Airbnb properties in Milan

##Let's look at the raw data

```{r}
glimpse(listings)

```

## Let's take a closer look

```{r}
skim(listings)

favstats(price ~ bedrooms, data=listings)
```
## Description... REMEMBER TO CHANGE IT 

There are 74 variables and 17,703 observations within the AirBnB dataset. 

The following variables are numbers.
```{r}
#Returning indicator names with type dbl
listings %>%
  select(where(is.numeric))%>%
  colnames()
```

The following variables are categorical/factor.
```{r}
#Returning indicator names with type character
listings %>%
  select(where(is.character))%>%
  colnames()

```

##CREATE SOME GRAPHS

###We create a barchart of the number of bedrooms, but we remove the outliers, so the properties that have more than 5 bedrooms.
```{r}
listings %>% 
  filter(bedrooms<=5) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=bedrooms))+
  geom_bar()+
  labs(title="Number of Airbnb properties in Milan grouped by bedrooms", x="Bedrooms",y="Number of properties")+
  NULL
```

###We create a histogram to understand the distribution of the average reviews for properties in Milan. As we can see from the graph, the vast majority of properties have ratings above 4. 
```{r}
listings %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=review_scores_rating))+
  geom_histogram()+
  labs(title="Distribution of ratings per Airbnb property in Milan", x="Ratings",y="Number of properties")+
  NULL
```

###We create a box plot to understand the distribution of the number of ratings per Airbnb property. We filter out the data and only analyze properties that have more than 100 reviews so to remove the properties that haven't been long enough on the "market" and hence haven't been used a lot.
```{r}
listings %>%
  filter(number_of_reviews>=100) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=number_of_reviews))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title="Boxplot of the number of reviews per Airbnb property in Milan", x="Number of Reviews")+
  NULL

```

###We create a density plot to understand the distribution of price per Airbnb property. We filter out the data and only analyze properties that have a price per night of less than 300 so to remove the outliers made by the properties that can be considered as "luxury" or that has a lot of bedroom, and hence are too big.
```{r}
#Changing price from str to numeric data type 
listings <- listings %>% 
  mutate(price = parse_number(as.character(price)))

listings %>%
  filter(price<=300) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=price))+
  geom_density()+
  labs(title="Distribution of the price per night per Airbnb property in Milan", x="Price per night",y="Density")+
  NULL

```
## Propery types

```{r}
proportion_listing <- listings %>%
  group_by(property_type) %>%
  count() %>%
  mutate(pct = scales::percent(n / 17703))

proportion_listing %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

The 4 most common property types are 'entire rental unit', 'private room in rental unit', 'entire condo' and 'entire loft'. These property types make up a combined 87% of the properties. (57%, 15%, 10% and 5% respectively).  

Since the vast majority of the observations in the data are one of the top four or five property types, we have chosen to create a simplified version of `property_type` variable that has 5 categories: the top four categories and `Other`.

```{r}
listings <- listings %>%
  mutate(prop_type_simplified = case_when(
    property_type %in% c("Entire rental unit","Private room in rental unit", "Entire condominium (condo)","Entire loft") ~ property_type, 
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))

```
       
```{r}
listings %>%
  count(property_type, prop_type_simplified) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) 

```


## Correlation within the dataset

We will now look at the correlation between selected variables in the dataset.

```{r}
listings %>% #Correlation between availability and price
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>% 
  select(price, availability_30,availability_60,availability_90,availability_365) %>% 
  ggpairs(aes(alpha=0.2))+
  theme_bw()
```
As per the graph the correlation between availability and price is not significantly high. This highlights that availablity of rooms does not affect the price. 

```{r}
listings %>% #Correlation between review and price 
  select(price, bedrooms,beds,review_scores_rating,review_scores_accuracy, review_scores_cleanliness,review_scores_checkin,
         review_scores_communication,review_scores_location,review_scores_value ) %>% 
  ggpairs(aes(alpha=0.2))+
  theme_bw()
```
As per the graph the correlation between ratings and price is not significantly high. This highlights that potentially lowered priced rooms receive a high rating, this signifies that customers care about value for money. There exists a significant correlation between the number of beds and price.

```{r}
listings %>%
  group_by(prop_type_simplified) %>%
  summarise(avg_price = mean(price)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = prop_type_simplified, y = avg_price)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Average Property Price of Different Property Types", 
       x = "Property Type",
       y = "Average Price Per Night") 
```

The barchart shown above implies that the entire loft would have the highest average price among all the property type, while private room in rental unit ranked the lowest. That makes sense to me since loft tends to have modern furniture than traditional type of building especially in European historic old cities like Milan. Also, loft is more spacious than other types, based on the personal experience of Francesco (our Italian group member). In addition, private room needs to share the living room with other tenants, which would reduce the comfortness of customers.

```{r}
listings %>%
  group_by(room_type) %>%
  summarise(avg_price = mean(price)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = room_type, y = avg_price)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Average Property Price of Different Room Types", 
       x = "Room Type",
       y = "Average Price Per Night") 
```

The barchart shown above implies that the hotel room has a much higher average price than any other room type, since customers need to pay for the premium of cleaning, security, free breakfast etc. In comparison, shared room has the lowest average price among all types, since the space needs to be shared with someone else. 

```{r}
listings %>%
  group_by(neighbourhood_cleansed) %>%
  summarise(avg_price = mean(price)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = avg_price, y = neighbourhood_cleansed)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Average Property Price of Different Neighbourhoods", 
       x = "Neighbour",
       y = "Average Price Per Night") 
```

Tre Torri has the highest average property price among all the neighbors. Tre Torri is located in the centre of the three towers, which can serve a substantial number of employees working in high-caliber companies. The facilities in this area is extremely modern, with only 14 years of history after groundbreaking, accompanied with a lot of parks for entertainment. Ronchetto delle Rane, on the other hand, has the lowest average property price, since it's located in suburb of Milan with outdated facilities.Tre Torri has the highest average property price among all the neighbors.

```{r}
correlation_matrix_data_1 <- listings %>% 
  select(price,bedrooms, accommodates)
corr <- round(cor(correlation_matrix_data_1), 1)
ggcorrplot(corr)  
``` 

## Data wrangling

```{r}
#Changing price from str to numeric data type 
listings <- listings %>% 
  mutate(price = parse_number(as.character(price)))
```

  
```{r}
typeof(listings$price)
```

We have confirmed that price is now formatted as a number.

Airbnb is most commonly used for travel purposes, i.e., as an alternative to traditional hotels. We only want to include  listings in our regression analysis that are intended for travel purposes:

The minimum nights that the Airbnb reported the most usually lies between 1 and 3.

```{r}
nights_listing <- listings %>%
  group_by(minimum_nights) %>%
  count() %>%
  mutate(pct = scales::percent(n / 17703))

nights_listing %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

The number of minimum nights that stands out is 30 days. A possible explanation is that the host prefers long term lettings. Furthermore, Airbnb wants them to stay longer; in that way, the capacity of the property can be increased, reducing the business risk. Another stand out duration of stay is the minimum of 7 nights, which is above a minimum of 6 nights, encouraging people to stay one entire week benefiting the host to reduce hassle. 



We have filtered the data so that it shows the minimum nights as less than or equal to 4 nights. 
```{r}
listings_4nights <- listings %>%
  filter(minimum_nights <= 4)

#Check if we have derived the dataset that included minimum_nights <= 4 only
listings_4nights %>%
  group_by(minimum_nights) %>%
  count()

listings %>% 
  filter(minimum_nights <= 4) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=minimum_nights))+
  geom_bar()+
  labs(title="Number of properties in Milan grouped by minimum nights", 
       subtitle="We only consider properties that have 4 or fewer minimum nights", 
       x="Minimum nights",
       y="Number of properties")+
  NULL
```


        
# Mapping 

```{r, out.width = '80%'}

leaflet(data = filter(listings, minimum_nights <= 4)) %>% 
  addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap.Mapnik") %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(lng = ~longitude, 
                   lat = ~latitude, 
                   radius = 1, 
                   fillColor = "blue", 
                   fillOpacity = 0.4, 
                   popup = ~listing_url,
                   label = ~property_type)
```

    
# Regression Analysis

We have created a new variable called 'price_4_nights' using 'price' and 'accomodates' to calculate the total cost for two people to stay at the Airbnb property for 4 nights.
```{r}
listings_4_nights_2_people <- listings %>%
  filter(minimum_nights <= 4 , maximum_nights >= 4, accommodates >=2)
  
listings_4_nights_2_people <-  listings_4_nights_2_people %>% 
  mutate(price_4_nights = price*4)
```

We should use og adjusted prices for the regression analysis as the variable is exnibiting a normal distribution.

```{r}
ggplot(data=listings_4_nights_2_people, aes(x= price_4_nights)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,1000)) +
  labs(title = 'Price distribution for accomodations in Milan for 4 days and 2 people', x = "Price", y = "Count") +
  theme_bw()

ggplot(data=listings_4_nights_2_people, aes(x= log(price_4_nights))) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_continuous() +
  labs(title = 'Log adjusted price distribution for accomodations in Milan for 4 days and 2 people', x = "Price", y = "Count") +
  theme_bw()

```

We have created a regression model called `model1` with the following explanatory variables: `prop_type_simplified`, `number_of_reviews`, and `review_scores_rating`. 
```{r}
log_listings_4_nights_2_people <-  listings_4_nights_2_people %>%  #Model 1 - Type of listing
  mutate(price_4_nights = log(price_4_nights))

model1 <- lm(price_4_nights ~ 
               prop_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating, 
             data = log_listings_4_nights_2_people)

log_listings_4_nights_2_people %>%
  group_by(prop_type_simplified) %>%
  summarise(count=n())

autoplot(model1)+ theme_bw()

get_regression_table(model1) 

get_regression_summaries(model1)

mosaic::msummary(model1)

car::vif(model1)  


```

Review_scores_rating is negatively correlated with the price. The review_scores_rating is significant is in predicting the price, as it has a t-value of -3.891. 

We want to determine if `room_type` is a significant predictor of the cost for 4 nights, given everything else in the model. We have created a regression model called model2 that includes all of the explananatory variables in `model1` plus `room_type`. 

```{r}
model2 <- lm(price_4_nights ~ 
               prop_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating + 
               room_type, 
             data = log_listings_4_nights_2_people)
  
log_listings_4_nights_2_people %>%
  group_by(room_type) %>%
  summarise(count=n())

autoplot(model2)+ theme_bw()

get_regression_table(model2) 

get_regression_summaries(model2)

mosaic::msummary(model2)

car::vif(model2)  
```

## Further variables/questions to explore on our own

Our dataset has many more variables, so here are some ideas on how you can extend your analysis

1. Are the number of `bathrooms`, `bedrooms`, `beds`, or size of the house (`accomodates`) significant predictors of `price_4_nights`? Or might these be co-linear variables?
```{r}
correlation_matrix_data_2 <- log_listings_4_nights_2_people %>% 
  select(price, bedrooms, bathrooms,beds)
corr <- round(cor(correlation_matrix_data_2), 1)
ggcorrplot(corr)

log_listings_4_nights_2_people %>% #Correlation between review and price 
  select(price, bedrooms,beds, accommodates) %>% 
  ggpairs(aes(alpha=0.2))+
  theme_bw()

```
```{r}
model3 <- lm(price_4_nights ~ #Including beds, bedrooms and accomodated in the explanatory variables 
               prop_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating + 
               room_type+
               bedrooms+
               beds+
               accommodates, 
             data = log_listings_4_nights_2_people)
  
log_listings_4_nights_2_people %>%
  group_by(room_type) %>%
  summarise(count=n())

autoplot(model3)+ theme_bw()

get_regression_table(model3) 

get_regression_summaries(model3)

mosaic::msummary(model3)

car::vif(model3)  
```
> From the model results we can see that bedrooms, beds and accomodates are significant predictors of the price. 

```{r}
model4 <- lm(price_4_nights ~ #removing bedrooms and bed to correct for the effect of multi-collinearity among these variables 
               prop_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating + 
               room_type+
               accommodates, 
             data = log_listings_4_nights_2_people)

1. Do superhosts `(host_is_superhost`) command a pricing premium, after controlling for other variables?
```{r}
model5 <- lm(price_4_nights ~ #removing bedrooms and bed to correct for the effect of multi-collinearity among these variables 
               prop_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating + 
               room_type+
               accommodates+
               host_is_superhost, 
             data = log_listings_4_nights_2_people)

```
> From the model result we can see that host_is_superhost is a significant explanatory variable.

1. Some hosts allow you to immediately book their listing (`instant_bookable == TRUE`), while a non-trivial proportion don't. After controlling for other variables, is `instant_bookable` a significant predictor of `price_4_nights`?
```{r}
model6 <- lm(price_4_nights ~ #removing bedrooms and bed to correct for the effect of multi-collinearity among these variables 
               prop_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating + 
               room_type+
               accommodates+
               instant_bookable, 
             data = log_listings_4_nights_2_people)
  
log_listings_4_nights_2_people %>%
  group_by(room_type) %>%
  summarise(count=n())

autoplot(model6)+ theme_bw()

get_regression_table(model6) 

get_regression_summaries(model6)

```
> From the model result we can see that instant_bookable is a significant explanatory variable.

1. For all cities, there are 3 variables that relate to neighbourhoods: `neighbourhood`, `neighbourhood_cleansed`, and `neighbourhood_group_cleansed`. There are typically more than 20 neighbourhoods in each city, and it wouldn't make sense to include them all in your model. Use your city knowledge, or ask someone with city knowledge, and see whether you can group neighbourhoods together so the majority of listings falls in fewer (5-6 max) geographical areas. You would thus need to create a new categorical variabale `neighbourhood_simplified` and determine whether location is a predictor of `price_4_nights`
 
```{r}
model7 <- lm(price_4_nights ~ 
               prop_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating + 
               room_type+
               accommodates+
               host_is_superhost+
               instant_bookable+
               neighbourhood_simplified, 
             data = log_listings_4_nights_2_people)
  
log_listings_4_nights_2_people %>%
  group_by(room_type) %>%
  summarise(count=n())

autoplot(model7)+ theme_bw()

get_regression_table(model7) 

get_regression_summaries(model7)

mosaic::msummary(model7)

car::vif(model7)
```

1. What is the effect of `avalability_30` or `reviews_per_month` on `price_4_nights`, after we control for other variables?
```{r}
model8 <- lm(price_4_nights ~ #removing bedrooms and bed to correct for the effect of multi-collinearity among these variables. also removing prop_type_simplified as it has a VIF of over 5  
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating + 
               room_type+
               accommodates+
               availability_30+
               reviews_per_month+
               neighbourhood_simplified, 
             data = log_listings_4_nights_2_people)
  
log_listings_4_nights_2_people %>%
  group_by(room_type) %>%
  summarise(count=n())

```


## Diagnostics, collinearity, summary tables

As you keep building your models, it makes sense to:

1. Check the residuals, using `autoplot(model_x)`
1. As you start building models with more explanatory variables, make sure you use `car::vif(model_x)`` to calculate the **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** for your predictors and determine whether you have colinear variables. A general guideline is that a VIF larger than 5 or 10 is large, and your model may suffer from collinearity. Remove the variable in question and run your model again without it.



1. Create a summary table, using `huxtable` (https://mfa2022.netlify.app/example/modelling_side_by_side_tables/) that shows which models you worked on, which predictors are significant, the adjusted $R^2$, and the Residual Standard Error.

```{r}
huxreg(model1,model2,model3,model4,model5,model6,model7,model8,
       statistics = c('#observations' = 'nobs', 
                      'R squared' = 'r.squared', 
                      'Adj. R Squared' = 'adj.r.squared', 
                      'Residual SE' = 'sigma'), 
       bold_signif = 0.05
       )


```

1. Finally, you must use the best model you came up with for prediction. Suppose you are planning to visit the city you have been assigned to over reading week, and you want to stay in an Airbnb. Find Airbnb's in your destination city that are apartments with a private room, have at least 10 reviews, and an average rating of at least 90. Use your best model to predict the total cost to stay at this Airbnb for 4 nights. Include the appropriate 95% interval with your prediction. Report the point prediction and interval in terms of `price_4_nights`. 
```{r}
filtered_dataset <- listings %>%
  filter(number_of_reviews >= 10, review_scores_rating >= 4.5,room_type == "Private room")
filtered_dataset
model_predictions <- broom::augment(model8, 
                             newdata = filtered_dataset)
model_prediction

```


  - if you used a log(price_4_nights) model, make sure you anti-log to convert the value in $. You can read more about [hot to interpret a regression model when some variables are log transformed here](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/faq/general/faqhow-do-i-interpret-a-regression-model-when-some-variables-are-log-transformed/)

# Deliverables


- By midnight on Monday 18 Oct 2021, you must upload on Canvas a short presentation (max 4-5 slides) with your findings, as some groups will be asked to present in class. You should present your Exploratory Data Analysis, as well as your best model. In addition, you must upload on Canvas your final report, written  using R Markdown to introduce, frame, and describe your story and findings. You should include the following in the memo:

1. Executive Summary: Based on your best model, indicate the factors that influence `price_4_nights`.
This should be written for an intelligent but non-technical audience. All
other sections can include technical writing.
2. Data Exploration and Feature Selection: Present key elements of the data, including tables and
graphs that help the reader understand the important variables in the dataset. Describe how the
data was cleaned and prepared, including feature selection, transformations, interactions, and
other approaches you considered.
3. Model Selection and Validation: Describe the model fitting and validation process used. State
the model you selected and why they are preferable to other choices.
4. Findings and Recommendations: Interpret the results of the selected model and discuss
additional steps that might improve the analysis
  
  

Remember to follow R Markdown etiquette rules and style; don't have the Rmd output extraneous messages or warnings, include summary tables in nice tables (use `kableExtra`), and remove any placeholder texts from past Rmd templates; in other words, (i.e. I don't want to see stuff I wrote in your final report.)
